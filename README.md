## Description

`purescript-mathbox` contains purescript bindings for [MathBox](https://gitgud.io/unconed/mathbox).

In case you don't know MathBox yet:

> MathBox is a library for rendering presentation-quality math diagrams in a browser using WebGL.
> Built on top of Three.js and ShaderGraph, it provides a clean API to visualize mathematical
> relationships and animate them declaratively.

## Try Mathbox

~~`purescript-mathbox` is available as a backend of try-purescript,
which means you can play online with it without having to install anything locally:
[try-mathbox](http://try.purescript.org/?backend=mathbox)~~ Not updated yet to new architecture of try-purescript.

## Examples

To get started, a couple of examples have been ported from the MathBox repos.
A fairly minimal example is:

Other examples are in the same directory: https://github.com/rintcius/purescript-mathbox/blob/master/test/Mathbox/Examples

## Contributing

Please feel free to file issues. However, note that I'll probably won't merge any PR's at the moment since the code in this lib is generated code (which is still private).
